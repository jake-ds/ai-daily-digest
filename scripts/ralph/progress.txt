# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- SCENARIOS dict is in `web/services/linkedin_service.py` (module-level) - used by both service and API
- `web/api/linkedin.py` has regex validators for scenario parameter (e.g., `^[A-F]$`) - update when adding scenarios
- `detect_scenario()` uses keyword-based heuristics with priority ordering (first match wins)
- Always `python -m py_compile` after editing Python files
- ReferencePost model: `web/models/reference_post.py` - content, author, source_url, analysis fields
- Guidelines examples in markdown use pattern: `### 시나리오 X 예시` followed by code block
- Both LinkedInService and LinkedInAgent need parallel changes for prompt improvements

## 2026-02-21 - LQ-005
- Added `_validate_draft(content, article_url)` method to LinkedInService
- Validates: char count (1200-1800), forbidden words, emoji check, article URL presence
- `generate_draft()` now calls validation and auto-retries up to 2 times with fix prompt
- FORBIDDEN_WORDS class constant: 여러분, 혁명, 패러다임 시프트, 게임체인저, 하세요, 해보세요, 읽어주셔서 감사
- Emoji check uses `unicodedata.category` to detect Symbol_Other chars
- Files changed: web/services/linkedin_service.py
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Emoji detection: `unicodedata.category(char).startswith("So")` covers most emoji symbols
  - Validation loop pattern: for attempt in range(max_retries), break on valid
  - Fix prompt includes current draft + specific issues for targeted correction
---

## 2026-02-21 - LQ-004
- Added `_build_article_context()` to both LinkedInService and LinkedInAgent
- Includes: category, score (with tone guide), viral_score (with context), authority source detection
- Score >= 8: "깊은 분석" guide, Score <= 5: "간결한 코멘터리" guide
- Authority sources: MIT, Stanford, Google, DeepMind, OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta AI, Microsoft Research
- Applied in simple mode (_build_prompt) and agent mode (_step_analyze, _step_draft)
- Files changed: web/services/linkedin_service.py, web/services/linkedin_agent.py
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Article model fields: score (Float), viral_score (Float, nullable), category (String), source (String)
  - _build_article_context() is a shared pattern now used by both service and agent
---

## 2026-02-21 - LQ-003
- Added `_get_reference_examples(scenario)` to both LinkedInService and LinkedInAgent
- DB reference posts (max 2) + guidelines example extraction via regex
- Included as "참고 예시" section in prompts for both simple and agent mode
- Files changed: web/services/linkedin_service.py, web/services/linkedin_agent.py
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ReferencePost has no scenario column - currently gets most recent posts regardless of scenario
  - Guidelines examples use `### 시나리오 X 예시` + code blocks - regex pattern extracts content between ```
  - Changes to prompt building in linkedin_service.py usually need mirror changes in linkedin_agent.py
---

## 2026-02-21 - LQ-002
- Integrated self.guidelines into _build_prompt() with conditional logic
- When guidelines file exists: full guidelines text included as "작성 지침서" section
- When guidelines empty: fallback to existing hardcoded rules (문체, 금지사항, 구조, 길이)
- Prompt structure: 페르소나 → 시나리오 → 기사 정보 → 지침서/규칙 → 출력 형식
- Files changed: web/services/linkedin_service.py
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - _build_prompt() uses f-string with conditional sections built as variables
  - self.guidelines loaded from LINKEDIN_GUIDELINES_PATH (data/linkedin_guidelines.md)
  - The hardcoded rules are a minimal fallback; the full guidelines file is much more comprehensive
---

## 2026-02-21 - LQ-001
- Added Scenario F (권위자 관점 + 역설적 인사이트) to SCENARIOS dict with all required fields
- Added Scenario F detection keywords to detect_scenario(): 권위자, expert, 통념, 학습, fomo, 배워야, 역설, misconception, myth, contrary
- Updated regex in web/api/linkedin.py from ^[A-E]$ to ^[A-F]$ (both generate and agent endpoints)
- Updated docstrings to reflect A-F range
- Files changed: web/services/linkedin_service.py, web/api/linkedin.py
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The regex `^[A-E]$` appears in TWO places in linkedin.py (generate_draft and agent_start) - use replace_all
  - detect_scenario() has priority ordering: more specific keywords first, Scenario F keywords last since they're broader
  - SCENARIOS dict fields: name, description, hook_style, structure, closing
